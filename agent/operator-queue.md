## 2026-05-03 — F1-F12 portfolio confirmation — confirm/edit family-business questions

The 12 F-class questions (F1-F6 Iranfarhang, F7-F12 Kipa) were generated from
deep-research agents on 2026-05-03 reviewing both business folders. They are
provisional and need your confirm/edit/replace pass.

**Agent recommendation:** keep all 12 as-is for first 30d; revise based on which
prove decision-useful vs noisy.

**Open issue:** which (if any) should be cut, modified, or added.

## 2026-05-03 — Phase 0 → Phase 1 transition trigger

Phase 0 MVP ships today with manual probabilities for all 32 questions.
Phase 1 (agent loop with 3-tier autonomy + reference-class registry seed)
upgrades when:
- Operator has loaded the new homepage at least once
- Operator has confirmed F1-F12 portfolio (above)
- Operator has approved ~$4,000/year operating budget

**Agent recommendation:** transition Phase 0 → Phase 1 within 14d of MVP launch
to avoid the model staying in operator-driven mode indefinitely.
